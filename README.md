# mumbleRF
A patched version of the Mumble voice chat software for use with two-way radio transceivers (ham radio, CB, PMR and others).

This software allows to connect two-way-radio transceivers to Mumble/murmur servers in order to extend the range of radio-frequency communications.

# Features
The software provides:
- A squelch (SQL) output to be connected with the transceiver's PTT (push to talk) input in order to set the transceiver to transmit-mode when audio is received from the mumble server.
- A PTT-input driven by the transceiver's SQL-output for sending audio to the mumble server when a radio frequency call is received.

The software is optimized for Raspberry Pi single board computers. Other platforms may be supported in the future.

Digital I/O is available via RS232 (USB2Serial or native) and Raspberry Pi GPIO-ports.
