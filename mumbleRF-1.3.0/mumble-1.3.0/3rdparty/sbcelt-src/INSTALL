To install SBCELT, simply run

 $ make  # or 'gmake' on FreeBSD to invoke GNU make

in this directory.  If the build succeeds, there should be
a 'libsbcelt.a' file in the lib directory, and a 'sbcelt-helper'
in the helper directory. Beside these two files, the only other
file needed to make use of SBCELT is the 'sbcelt.h' header which
lives in the root of the source tree.

Proper locations for these files depend on the environment
that the library is intended to run within.  Currently,
SBCELT is mostly meant to be embedded into other applications,
and ass such, the only sane default is to delegate the
installation process to the program embedding SBCELT.
