- Check minimum width of bands
- Revisit energy resolution based on the bit-rate
- Revisit static bit allocation (as a function of frame size and channels)
- Dynamic adjustment of energy quantisation
- Psychacoustics
  * Error shaping within each band
  * Decisions on the rate
- Intensity stereo decisions
- Dynamic (intra-frame) bit allocation 
- Joint encoding of stereo energy

- Encode band shape (or just tilt)?
- Make energy encoding more robust to losses?


Misc:
Detect uint decoding and flag them in the decoder directly
If we attempt to write too many bits on the encoder side, set a flag instead of
aborting
Save "raw bytes" at the end of the stream
