\section{Introduction}
This document is meant to be a reference for the Mumble VoIP 1.2.X server-client communication protocol. It reflects the state of the protocol implemented in the Mumble 1.2.2 client and might be outdated by the time you are reading this. Be sure to check for newer revisions of this document on our website \url{http://www.mumble.info} . At the moment this document is work in progress.

\section{Overview}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{resources/mumble_system_overview}
	\caption{Mumble system overview}
	\label{fig:mumble_system_overview}
\end{figure}

Mumble is based on a standard server-client communication model. It utilizes two channels of communication, the first one is a TCP connection which is used to reliably transfer control data between the client and the server. The second one is a UDP connection which is used for unreliable, low latency transfer of voice data.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{resources/mumble_crypt_types}
	\caption{Mumble crypto types}
	\label{fig:mumble_crypt_types}
\end{figure}

Both are protected by strong cryptography, this encryption is mandatory and cannot be disabled. The TCP control channel uses TLSv1 AES256-SHA\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security }} while the voice channel is encrypted with OCB-AES128\footnote{\url{http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/ocb-back.htm}}.

While the TCP connection is mandatory the UDP connection can be compensated by tunnelling the UDP packets through the TCP connection as described in the protocol description later.

\section{Protocol stack (TCP)}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{resources/mumble_protocol_stack}
	\caption{Mumble protocol stack}
	\label{fig:mumble_protocol_stack}
\end{figure}

Mumble has a shallow and easy to understand stack. Basically it uses Google's Protocol Buffers\footnote{\url{http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/}} with simple prefixing to distinguish the different kinds of packets sent through an TLSv1 encrypted connection. This makes the protocol very easily expandable.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{resources/mumble_packet}
	\caption{Mumble packet}
	\label{fig:mumble_packet}
\end{figure}

The prefix consists out of the two bytes defining the type of the packet in the payload and 4 bytes stating the length of the payload in bytes followed by the payload itself. The following packet types are available in the current protocol and all but UDPTunnel are simple protobuf messages. If not mentioned otherwise all fields are little-endian encoded.

%FIGURE GOES HERE

For raw representation of each packet type see the attached Mumble.proto file.

\section{Establishing a connection}
This section describes the communication between the server and the client during connection establishing, note that only the TCP connection needs to be established for the client to be connected. After this the client will be visible to the other clients on the server and able to send other types of messages.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{resources/mumble_connection_setup}
	\caption{Mumble connection setup}
	\label{fig:mumble_connection_setup}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Connect}
As the basis for the synchronization procedure the client has to first establish the TCP connection to the server and do a common TLSv1 handshake. To be able to use the complete feature set of the Mumble protocol it is recommended that the client provides a strong certificate to the server. This however is not mandatory as you can connect to the server without providing a certificate. However the server must provide the client with its certificate and it is recommended that the client checks this.

\subsection{Version exchange}
Once the TLS handshake is completed both sides should transmit their version information using the Version message. The message structure is described below.

\begin{figure}[H]\begin{center}

\begin{mumbleMessage}{Version}
	version		& uint32 \\
	release		& string \\
	os			& string \\
	os\_version	& string
\end{mumbleMessage}

\caption{Version message}\label{msg:conn:version}
\end{center}\end{figure}

The version field is a combination of major, minor and patch version numbers (e.g. 1.2.0) so that major number takes two bytes and minor and patch numbers take one byte each. The structure is shown in figure \ref{fig:versionEncoding}. The release, os and os\_version fields are common strings containing additional information. This information is not interpreted in any way at the moment.

\begin{figure}[H]\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|@{\hspace{0.5cm}}c@{\hspace{0.5cm}}|c|c|}

\hline
Major	& Minor	& Patch \\
2B		& 1B	& 1B \\
\hline

\end{tabular}

\caption{\texttt{version} field structure}\label{fig:versionEncoding}

\end{center}\end{figure}

\subsection{Authenticate}
Once the client has sent the version it should follow this with the Authenticate message. The message structure is described below in figure \ref{msg:conn:authenticate}. This message may be sent immediately after sending the version message. The client does not need to wait for the server version message.

\begin{figure}[H]\begin{center}
\begin{mumbleMessage}{Authenticate}
	username	& string \\
	password	& string \\
	tokens		& repeated string
\end{mumbleMessage}
\caption{Authenticate message}\label{msg:conn:authenticate}
\end{center}\end{figure}

The username and password are UTF-8 encoded strings. While the client is free to accept any username from the user the server is allowed to impose further restrictions. Furthermore if the client certificate has been registered with the server the client is primarily known with the username they had when the certificate was registered. For more information see the server documentation.

The password must only be provided if the server is passworded, the client provided no certificate but wants to authenticate to an account which has a password set, or to access the SuperUser account.

The third field contains a list of zero or more token strings which act as passwords that may give the client access to certain ACL groups without actually being a registered member in them, again see the server documentation for more information.

\subsection{Crypt setup}
Once the Version packets are exchanged the server will send a CryptSetup packet to the client. It contains the necessary cryptographic information for the OCB-AES128 encryption used in the UDP Voice channel. The packet is described in figure \label{msg:conn:cryptSetup}. The encryption itself is described later in section \ref{sect:udpEncryption}.

\begin{figure}[H]\begin{center}
\begin{mumbleMessage}{CryptSetup}
	key				& bytes \\
	client\_nonce	& bytes \\
	server\_nonce	& bytes
\end{mumbleMessage}

\caption{CryptSetup message}\label{msg:conn:cryptSetup}
\end{center}\end{figure}

\subsection{Channel states}
\label{sect:conn:channels}

After the client has successfully authenticated the server starts listing the channels by transmitting partial ChannelState message for every channel on this server. These messages lack the channel link information as the client does not yet have full picture of all the channels. Once the initial ChannelState has been transmitted for all channels the server updates the linked channels by sending new packets for these. The full structure of these ChanneLState messages is shown in \ref{msg:conn:channelState}.

\begin{figure}[H]\begin{center}
\begin{mumbleMessage}{ChannelState}
	channel\_id	& uint32 \\
	parent		& uint32 \\
	name		& string \\
	links		& uint32, repeated \\
	description	& string \\
	links\_add	& uint32, repeated \\
	links\_remove	& uint32, repeated \\
	temporary	& bool, optional \\
	position	& int32, optional
\end{mumbleMessage}
\caption{ChannelState message}\label{msg:conn:channelState}
\end{center}\end{figure}

\emph{The server must send a ChannelState for the root channel identified with ID 0.}

\subsection{User states}
\label{sect:conn:users}

After the channels have been synchronized the server continues by listing the connected users. This is done by sending a UserState message for each user currently on the server, including the user that is currently connecting. The message structure is shown in figure \ref{msg:conn:userState}.

\begin{figure}[H]\begin{center}
\begin{mumbleMessage}{ChannelState}
session			& uint32 \\
actor			& uint32 \\
name			& string \\
user\_id		& uint32 \\
channel\_id		& uint32 \\
mute			& bool \\
deaf			& bool \\
suppress		& bool \\
self\_mute		& bool \\
self\_deaf		& bool \\
texture			& bytes \\
plugin\_context	& bytes \\
plugin\_identity	& string \\
comment			& string \\
hash			& string \\
comment\_hash	& bytes \\
texture\_hash	& bytes \\
priority\_speaker	& bool \\
recording		& bool
\end{mumbleMessage}
\caption{UserState message}\label{msg:conn:userState}
\end{center}\end{figure}


\subsection {Server sync}
\label{sect:serverSync}

The client has now received a copy of the parts of the server state he needs to know about. To complete the synchronization the server transmits a ServerSync message containing the session id of the clients session, the maximum bandwidth allowed on this server, the servers welcome text as well as the permissions the client has in the channel he ended up.

%FIGURE GOES HERE
For more information pease refer to \nameref{appendix:mumble_proto} in the appendix.

\subsection {Ping}

If the client wishes to maintain the connection to the server it is required to ping the server. If the server does not receive a ping for 30 seconds it will disconnect the client.

\section {Voice data}

\subsection{Enabling the UDP channel}
\label{sect:udpping}

Before the UDP channel can reliably be used both sides should be certain that the connection works. Before the server may use the UDP connection to the client the client must first open a UDP socket and communicate its address to the server by sending a packet over UDP. Once the server has received an UDP transmission the server should start using the UDP channel for the voice packets. Respectively the client should not use the UDP channel for voice data until it is certain that the packets go through to the server.

In practice these requirements are filled with UDP ping. When the server receives a UDP ping packet (See figure \ref{fig:udpping}) from the client it echoes the packet back. When the client receives this packet it can ascertain that the UDP channel works for two-way communication.

\begin{figure}[H]\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|rcl|p{0.3\textwidth}}

\cline{1-3}
byte &:& type/flags & \texttt{0010 0000} for Ping \\
\cline{1-3}
varint &:& timestamp & Timestamp for the client. \\
\cline{1-3}

\end{tabular}
\caption{UDP Ping packet}\label{fig:udpping}
\end{center}\end{figure}

If the client stops receiving replies to the UDP packets at some point or never receives the first one it should immediately start tunneling the voice communication through TCP as described in section \ref{sect:udptunnel}. When the server receives a tunneled packet over the TCP connection it must also stop using the UDP for communication. The client may continue sending UDP ping packets over the UDP channel and the server must echo these if it receives them. If the client later receives these echoes it may switch back to the UDP channel for voice communication. When the server receives a UDP voice communication packet from the client it should stop tunneling the packets as well.

\subsection{Data}

The voice data is transmitted in variable length packets that consist of header portion, followed by repeated data segments and an optional position part. The full packet structure is shown in figure \ref{fig:udpvoice}. The decrypted data should never be longer than 1020 bytes, this allows the use of 1024 byte UDP buffer even after the 4-byte encryption header is added to the packet during the encryption. The protocol transfers 64-bit integers using variable length encoding. This encoding is specified in section \ref{sect:varint}.

\begin{figure}[H]\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{l|rcl|p{0.5\textwidth}}

\cline{2-4}
\textbf{Header} & byte &:& type/target & Bit 1-3: Type, Bit 4-8: Target \\
				\cline{2-4}
				& varint &:& session & The session number of the source user \\
				\cline{2-4}
				& varint &:& sequence & \\
				\cline{2-4}
\multicolumn{5}{c}{} \\
				\cline{2-4}
\textbf{Audio}	& byte &:& header & Bit 1: Terminator, Bit 2-8: Data length \\
				\cline{2-4}
Repeated		& byte[] &:& data & Encoded voice frames\\
				\cline{2-4}
\multicolumn{5}{c}{} \\
				\cline{2-4}

\textbf{Position} & float &:& Pos 1 & Positional audio positions \\
				\cline{2-4}
Optional		& float &:& Pos 2 & Uses PacketDataStream encoding \\
				\cline{2-4}
				& float &:& Pos 3 & \\
				\cline{2-4}

\end{tabular}
\caption{UDP Voice packet}\label{fig:udpvoice}
\end{center}\end{figure}

The first byte of the header contains the packet type and additional target specifier. The type is stored in the first three bits and specifies the type and encoding of the packet. Current types are listed in table \ref{tbl:udptypes}. The remaining 5 bits specify additional packet-wide options. For voice packets the values specify the voice target as listed in table \ref{tbl:udptargets}.

\begin{table}[H]\begin{center}
	\caption{UDP Types}\label{tbl:udptypes}

	\begin{tabular}{ll}
		Type & Description \\
		\hline
		0	& CELT Alpha encoded voice data \\
		1	& Ping packet (See section \ref{sect:udpping}) \\
		2	& Speex encoded voice data \\
		3	& CELT Beta encoded voice data \\
		4-7 & Unused
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}\end{table}

\begin{table}[H]\begin{center}
	\caption{UDP targets}\label{tbl:udptargets}

	\begin{tabular}{ll}
		Target & Description \\
		\hline
		0	& Normal talking \\
		1	& Whisper to channel \\
		2-30	& Direct whisper \\
			& Always 2 for incoming whisper. \\
		31	& Server loopback
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}\end{table}

The audio frames consist of one byte long header and up to 127 bytes long data portion. The first bit in the header is the \texttt{Terminator bit} which informs the receiver whether there are more audio frames after this one. This bit is turned on (value \texttt{1}) for all but the last frame in the current UDP packet. Rest of the seven bits in the header specify the length of the data portion. The data portion is encoded using one of the supported codecs. The exact codec is specified in the type portion of the whole packet (See table \ref{tbl:udptypes}). \emph{The data in each frame is encoded separately.}

\subsection{Codecs}
\label{sect:codecs}

Mumble supports two distinct codecs; Low bit rate audio uses Speex and higher quality audio is encoded with CELT. Both of these codecs must be supported for full support of the Mumble protocol. Furthermore, as the CELT bitstream has not been frozen yet which places requirements for the exact CELT version: The clients must support CELT 0.7.1 bitstream. The protocol includes codec negotiation which allows clients to support other codec versions as well, in which case the server should attempt to negotiate a version that all clients support. The clients must respect the server resolution.

\subsubsection{Whispering}
\label{sect:whispering}

Normal talking can be heard by the users of the current channel and all linked channels as long as the speaker has Talk permission on these channels. If the speaker wishes to broadcast the voice to specific users or channels, he may use whispering. This is achieved by registering a voice target using the VoiceTarget message (See \ref{msg:voiceTarget}) and specifying the target ID as the target in the first byte of the UDP packet.

\subsection {\texttt{varint}, 64-bit integer encoding}
\label{sect:varint}

The variable length integer encoding is used to encode long, 64-bit, integers so that short values do not need the full 8 bytes to be transferred. The basic idea behind the encoding is prefixing the value with a length prefix and then removing the leading zeroes from the value. The positive numbers are always right justified. That is to say that the least significant bit in the encoded presentation matches the least significant bit in the decoded presentation. Table \ref{tbl:varint} contains the definitions of the different length prefixes. The encoded \texttt{x} bits are part of the decoded number while the \texttt{\_} signifies a unused bit. Encoding should be done by searching the first decoded description that fits the number that should be decoded, truncating it to the required bytes and combining it with the defined encoding prefix. 

\begin{table}[H]\begin{center}
	\caption{\texttt{varint} prefixes}\label{tbl:varint}

	\begin{tabular}{ll}
		Encoded & Decoded \\
		\hline
		\texttt{0xxxxxxx} & 1 byte with $7 \cdot 8 + 1$ leading zeroes \\
		\texttt{10xxxxxx} + 1 byte & 2 bytes with $6 \cdot 8 + 2$ leading zeroes \\
		\texttt{110xxxxx} + 2 bytes & 3 bytes with $5 \cdot 8 + 3$ leading zeroes \\
		\texttt{1110xxxx} + 3 bytes & 4 bytes with $4 \cdot 8 + 4$ leading zeroes \\
		\texttt{111100\_\_} + \texttt{int} (4 bytes) & 32-bit positive number \\
		\texttt{111101\_\_} + \texttt{long} (8 bytes) & 64-bit number \\
\\
		\texttt{111110\_\_} + \texttt{varint} & Negative \texttt{varint} \\
		\texttt{111111xx} & Negative two byte number (-xx) \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}\end{table}

% The variable length integer encoding is used to encode long (64-bit) integers so that short values do not need the full 8 bytes to be transferred. The encoding function is given below. While it might seem complex it is worth noting that the $(a_v, a_p) \append (b_v, b_p)$ function equals appending the $a_p$ bits long value $a_v$ to a byte stream that already has the $b_p$ bits long value $b_v$.

% Encoding function
% \begin{align*}
% 	(a_v, a_p) \append (b_v, b_p) &= (2^{b_p} a_v + b_v, a_p + b_p) \\

% 	e(x) &= \begin{dcases*}

% \end{align*}

\subsection{TCP tunnel}
\label{sect:udptunnel}

When the UDP packets are tunneled through the TCP tunnel they are prefixed with the TCP protocol header that contains the packet type and length and sent through the connection. (Figure \ref{fig:udptunnel}) These packets do not use protocol buffer messages.

\begin{figure}[H]\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|@{\hspace{0.5cm}}c@{\hspace{0.5cm}}|@{\hspace{3cm}}c@{\hspace{3cm}}|}

\hline
Type	& Length	& UDP Packet \\
1B		& 3B		& 0-1020B \\
\hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{UDP Voice packet}\label{fig:udptunnel}
\end{center}\end{figure}

\subsection{Encryption}

All the voice packets are encrypted once during transfer. The actual encryption depends on the used transport layer. If the packets are tunneled through TCP they are encrypted using the TLS that encrypts the whole TCP connection and if they are sent directly using UDP they must be encrypted using the OCB-AES128 encryption. The OCB-AES128 encryption is described in section \ref{sect:cryptostate}.

\subsection{Implementation notes}

\emph{\small{When implementing the protocol it is easier to ignore the UDP transfer layer at first and just tunnel the UDP data through the TCP tunnel. The TCP layer must be implemented for authentication in any case. Making sure that the voice transmission works before implementing the UDP protocol simplifies debugging greatly. The UDP protocol is a required part of the specification though.}}
